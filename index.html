        <h2>Betty Boop - A History</h2>
        <p>Betty Boop began as both a parody and a powerful symbol 
            of unabashed sexuality, a combination she would retain, 
            to varying degrees, throughout her lifespan in the media. 
            She first appeared in 1930 as an anthropomorphic cartoon 
            french poodle in the short Dizzy Dishes, where she sang, danced, 
            and wagged her ears. A year later, she had transitioned 
            into a human character, her flappy ears morphing into her 
            now-famous hoop earrings. At once ingenuous, gentle, and 
            kind, she was a female figure who stood out in the world 
            of American animation and comics; whereas early characters 
            like Minnie Mouse were often largely just copies of male 
            figures in women’s clothing, Betty Boop was unique. Unlike 
            Olive Oyl in “Popeye” or Minnie Mouse, she wasn’t defined 
            by her relation to a more famous male character; she was 
            the main figure all on her own. Origanlly based on an
            American singer Helen Kane; however it came to light that
            Helen had based her act on African American signer Baby 
            Esther Jones, known for her "put-on" baby style voice. Credit:
